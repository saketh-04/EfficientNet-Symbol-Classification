## 📌 Project Overview

Symbol classification plays a crucial role in document processing, OCR systems, sign recognition, and automated understanding of symbolic data.  
This project leverages **EfficientNet**, known for its excellent accuracy-to-parameter ratio, to build a high-performance classifier.

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ EfficientNet-based deep learning model  
✅ Preprocessing and augmentation applied to symbol dataset  
✅ Training, validation & testing support  
✅ Plotting accuracy/loss curves  
✅ Evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)  
✅ Easy-to-understand notebook structure  
✅ Ready for deployment or further research

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

The model is built using:

- **EfficientNet-B0/B1/B2** (whichever version you trained)
- Transfer learning with pretrained ImageNet weights  
- Fully connected classifier head  
- ReLU activation layers  
- Softmax output for multi-class classification  

EfficientNet is chosen because it provides:

✅ High accuracy  
✅ Reduced computational cost  
✅ Scales depth, width, and resolution efficiently
